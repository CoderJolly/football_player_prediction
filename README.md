 # Football Player Market Value Prediction

## Problem Statement
In the English Premier League, May - July represents a lull period due to the lack of club football. What makes up for it, is the intense transfer speculation that surrounds all major player transfers today. You must have seen "Moneyball", where Peter Brand explains Billy Beane that "Its about getting things down to one number using stats the way we read them (players), we find value in player nobody else can see." Therefore, an important part of negotiations is predicting the fair market price for a player and perhaps perform EDA for this.
